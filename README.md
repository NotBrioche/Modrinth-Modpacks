# Introduction

Welcome to the repo ! This project is designed to share my modpacks I'm using for datapack and plugin development with explanations how to customize them and why I use these mods.

# Features

I made 4 modpack for players you to use, feel free to modify them as you need but it should be covering most use cases.
| Modpack      | Features                                       |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Classic**  | Optimisations, Texture pack compatibility, PVP |
| **Datapack** | Build, Datapack creation, Online forwarding    |
| **Plugin**   | Lightweight, Network Optimisations             |
| **All**      | Contains all the mods from modpacks            |

If you want to see a list of all the mods for each modpack, there is a list [here](modpacks/modpacks.md).

## Compatibility

I'm using [Packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) to create the modpack files, to use them I recommand using [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) but this is also compatible with [AtLauncher](https://atlauncher.com), [MultiMC](https://multimc.org) and [Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org)

# Customization

Some mods are present in every modpack like [Custom HUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/customhud) or [Shared Resources](#), they offer a good experience with a great range for customization. Presets are made in the modpacks but you can change it anytime, there is a list for [very useful mods](modpacks/general.md) and how to use them.

# Updating mods

[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com) have an option to directly update the version but I don't recommand it for you, if you try updating mods directly older mods will be ignored and after updating everything you will likely end with a conflict. I will be updating frequently for newer versions with informations on the non-avalible mods.

# Participating

If you have any suggestions for mods I could use in my modpack let me know, I will take time to respond with my opinion and maybe add it to the list.
